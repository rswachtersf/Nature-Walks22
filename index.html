 <!-- Welcome to My Nature Outing, where you'll use code to process and share your experiences with others. While you are making your visit to nature, gather pictures, sounds, and words you'll use in this document.

To get started making this document, you'll need to download the code from GitHub. If you want to easily publish your Nature Study on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, download code to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure folder where you'll be able to find them and organize assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. You'll also need a text editor like "brackets.io", "atom.io", or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Nature Communication.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML code comments be, or delete them.-->

<!--First, we'll need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website works. You can keep the title of this HTML document, "My Nature Outing," or change it to whatever you want to call it. Your new text will appear in your browser tab.-->

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name to one word). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match your image asset. Next, change the other relevant information in this section."-->

   <!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system? We'll also think about how we can capture:

- Framing
- Lines
- Symmetry and Patterns
- Viewpoint, angle
- Background
- Depth
- *Wabi Sabi*-->

  <!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Then you'll need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences-->

    <h2>The Project</h2><br>
    <p>The My Nature Outing Website Unit combines three fields of study: Environmental Justice, Data Science, and Computer Science.  In this unit, students are introduced to Environmental Justice as they participate in a nature walk around their school community. They learn that humans have an impact on their environment and that when decisions are made concerning environmental regulations that everyone, regardless of race, income, or location should have access to a healthy environment. Students collect, analyze, and report on qualitative data throughout the unit.  While on their nature walk, students collect images of nature to share what they see on their walk.  Additionally, collect data through their senses. They write down what they see, hear, feel, and smell on their walk.  They also interview classmates, family members, or professionals about their experiences with nature or their opinions on environmental issues.  They report all of their findings, images, and interviews on their websites. Students use Computer Science throughout this unit as well.  They learn about file management as they transfer image files from an iPod to their Google Drive to a folder on their desktop.  They remix an index.HTML file template to begin learning the structure of HTML code. They add their images, text, and sound files to the HTML code as they build their website incrementally and iteratively.  In the end, every student has a publishable website telling about their experience in nature.</p><br>

    <h3>Descriptive Writing</h3>

        <p>Students start by collecting 5 to 20 words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) to describe what they experienced on their nature walk.  They can look at their pictures, collect names of trees, plants, animals, insects, and other things they saw on their nature walk.  They are encouraged to think about their other senses as well.  They should include words to describe what they heard, smelled, or maybe felt.</p>
        <p>Once they have created their word bank, they have their choice of writing a descriptive paragraph about their time in nature or a poem in whatever form they choose.  They should try to include as many of the words from their word bank in their writing.</p>

       <p>Students are introduced to the term <em>Environmental Justice</em>.</p>
       <p>“Environmental Justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. EJ is an important part of the struggle to improve and maintain a clean and healthful environment, especially for those who have traditionally lived, worked, and played closest to the sources of pollution (EPA, 2017).”</p>
       <p>When interviewing friends, family members, or experts about their experiences in nature or opinions on environmental issues, studnets were encouraged to include a question or two concerning environmental justice.</p>
       <p> Students conducted their interviews using Audacity on their computers. Then they saved their recordings to be included on their websites.</p><br>
  </div>


         <!--It's time to switch to a different mode, to that of listening. Let's think about sounds we might be able to capture in our nature study. This could be wind blowing, birds chirping, footsteps trudging, water rolling...what do you hear that you can share with your audience? Often audio gets recorded as .wav files and it's then converted into mp4s which are much smaller and lower quality, but easier to embed in websites. Place either high quality .wav files or lower quality .mp3 files in the music folder and label them to match your code.-->
